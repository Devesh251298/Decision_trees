# Decision Tree Coursework - Intro to ML


## Description
In this project a decision tree algorithm is implemented and used to determine one of the indoor locations based on WIFI signal strengths collected from a mobile phone.

## Usage
To make use of this algorithm, run ```python main.py``` in the command line. This will return and save the results from the decision tree classifier. The results of running the scrip consists of (all done for both the clean and noisy datasets):

1. 10-fold cross validation
2. The evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score)
3. 10-fold cross-validation with pruning
4. The average accuracy




## Calculate Entropy

## Find Split

## Decision Classifier
